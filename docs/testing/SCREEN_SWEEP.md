_Last updated: 2026-06-10 · Status: **Analytics swept — all 11 endpoints live+200 for HR/SUPER; 2 FE fixes (AN-1: route had no role guard → manager/employee wall of 403s, now RoleGate'd; AN-2: dead Department filter + Custom range now wired through all endpoints — backend filter contract handed off in BACKEND_API_REQUESTS.md). Next: Permissions.**_

---

## 1. Mission

Drive every screen in the sidebar (Dashboard → Settings) **and all of its sub-panels**
through the real app against the **live test backend**, as each role, executing every
form/flow **end-to-end**. Log every error into this doc, then fix them **one by one**
(per-screen cadence). The goal is to flush out silent-failure bugs (forms that submit
nothing, saves that no-op, 500s from missing backend validation, broken states) of the
same class already found and fixed (see §6).

---

## 2. Scope

**In scope — 12 top-level screens, sidebar order:**

1. Dashboard
2. Employees (list + profile tabs + new/edit)
3. Departments
4. Attendance
5. Timesheets
6. Leave
7. Holidays
8. Payroll (runs, run-detail panels, global, migration, my-payslips)
9. Reports (15 report types)
10. Analytics (widgets + range toggles)
11. Permissions (matrix)
12. Settings (~24 sub-panels)

**Out of scope (for now):** Recruitment, Performance, Assets, Announcements (post-Settings
nav items); the **AUDITOR** role (no creds available).

Real unit count is ~80+ testable panels (each report type, profile tab, run-detail panel,
settings panel, drawer counts as its own unit). See each screen's section in §7.

## 3. Rules of engagement (agreed)

| Decision                  | Choice                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roles**                 | SUPER_ADMIN, HR_ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE. **No AUDITOR.**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Writes**                | **Full end-to-end, incl. irreversible** (test DB). Approve/mark-paid/terminate/delete are all fair game.                                                                                                                         |
| **Destructive-test data** | Use **throwaway tagged records** (prefix `ZZZ E2E`) for terminate/delete so the **seed role accounts stay intact** (we need aman/priya to keep logging in).                                                                      |
| **Cadence**               | Sweep one screen (all roles) → log all findings here → **fix that screen's issues** (`pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm lint`, commit each) → update §4/§5/§8 (+ **§6B** for any backend-side issue) → **pause for review** → next screen. |
| **Doc**                   | This file (`docs/testing/SCREEN_SWEEP.md`).                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Environment & access

- **Live test backend** via BFF. `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` is **off**.
- Dev server usually already running at `http://localhost:3000` (a 2nd `pnpm dev` just exits — reuse 3000).
- Backend base (for direct API verification): `https://employee-management-system-2b9q.onrender.com/api/v1`
- **Seed creds** (password `Password123!`):
  - `superadmin@acme.test` — SUPER_ADMIN
  - `hr@acme.test` — HR_ADMIN
  - `aman@acme.test` — MANAGER
  - `priya@acme.test` — EMPLOYEE
- **Verify discipline:** trust the **live API**, not docs (`API_MAPPING.md`/`CLAUDE.md` can be stale). Confirm a real response before changing FE code.

### Test method (Playwright)

Playwright is **not** a project dep — resolve from the npx cache via `createRequire`:

```js
import { createRequire } from 'module';
const require = createRequire(
  'C:/Users/mohds/AppData/Local/npm-cache/_npx/e41f203b7505f1fb/node_modules/_.js',
);
const { chromium } = require('playwright'); // v1.60.0, chromium build 1223 installed
```

Login by driving the form (`input[type=email]` / `input[type=password]` / `button[type=submit]`),
or for API verification log in via `POST /auth/login` and reuse the `set-cookie` in a single
`.mjs` (the Bash sandbox does not persist `/tmp` across calls). Put throwaway probe scripts in
`scripts/` (gitignored/untracked — delete when done; do **not** commit them).

**What to capture per screen, per role:**

- [ ] Console **errors/warnings** + unhandled promise rejections (on load + on interaction)
- [ ] Network **4xx/5xx** — record method, path, response body
- [ ] **Four states** render: loading / empty / error / success
- [ ] **Every form/drawer/dialog submitted** end-to-end — and assert a real network call **actually fired** (the silent-failure catch)
- [ ] **Permission/role gating** correct (right actions shown/hidden/enforced per role)
- [ ] Obvious dark-mode / responsive breakage (light touch)

### Severity legend

- **P0** — blocker: screen unusable, data loss, security, hard crash
- **P1** — major: a primary action silently fails / 500s / wrong data
- **P2** — minor: edge-case failure, missing state, confusing-but-recoverable
- **P3** — cosmetic: styling, copy, dark-mode/responsive nit

## 4. Progress (THE resume pointer)

**Current screen:** Analytics — ✅ done (2 FE fixes, AN-1 + AN-2). All 11 endpoints live+200 for HR/SUPER
(the 4 "newer" ones shipped — no 404s). HR/SUPER render clean; manager/employee now gated; the top-bar
Department + Custom-range filters are now wired through every endpoint (backend honours them later).
**Next action:** run the **Permissions** sweep (`/permissions` — roles × permissions matrix, toggle + save),
all roles. The route is already `RoleGate roles={['SUPER_ADMIN']}` (see `permissions/page.tsx`) → only
super_admin sees the matrix; HR/MANAGER/EMPLOYEE should get the access-denied state (verify). Drive the
**matrix toggle + Save** end-to-end and assert `PATCH /settings/roles-permissions` actually fires (silent-
failure catch). Watch CC-9 (field names) / CC-10 (bodyless writes).

## 5. Cross-cutting memory (read before every screen)

Shared engines / components / contracts and the bug **patterns** found so far. When a new
screen uses one of these, check it against this list first.

### Known bug patterns to actively probe on every screen

- **CC-1 · Native number-input `step` silently blocks submit.** A `type="number"` input with a
  fixed `step` (e.g. `step={1000}`) makes the browser reject "round" values via HTML5
  validation; the `:invalid` input blocks the form's submit event **before RHF/Zod run**, so
  the form silently does nothing. _Fix pattern: `step="any"`._ **Audit every numeric input**
  (CTC, amounts, hours, counts, percentages) across DynamicForm and bespoke forms. _(First
  seen: Salary Assignment CTC — fixed, commit `cb01083`.)_
- **CC-2 · Backend coerces `null → ""`/`0` and feeds Prisma without validation.** Sending an
  explicit `null` for an enum/typed field can 500 the endpoint (`prisma.*.create()` invalid
  invocation). _Fix pattern: omit null optional fields in the service request body._ **Watch
  every create/update payload** that sends nullable enum/typed fields. _(First seen: pay-group
  component overrides — fixed, commit `f9d42c9`.)_
- **CC-3 · `/auth/me` returns `400 INVALID_TENANT`, not `401`, when the token is absent/expired.**
  Handled in the axios interceptor (commit `6640cbb`). If any flow mis-detects auth state,
  suspect non-401 auth failures.
- **CC-4 · Immutable salary history.** Once a pay group is assigned to an employee it (and its
  components) can't be DELETEd (`409 GROUP_HAS_EMPLOYEES` / `COMPONENT_IN_USE`) — only marked
  inactive. Plan payroll cleanup accordingly.
- **CC-5 · Backend effective-dating oddities.** Observed salary history with `effectiveTo`
  **before** `effectiveFrom`, and duplicate same-day records. Treat payroll date math with
  suspicion; verify against live.
- **CC-6 · Leave approve/reject/withdraw are `PATCH`, not `POST` (FE is correct; docs stale).**
  `leave.api.ts` uses `PATCH /leave/requests/:id/{approve,reject,withdraw}` and these work live
  (withdraw → 200 verified). `CLAUDE.md §3` lists them as `POST` — that's stale. When testing
  Leave, use PATCH. _(Not a bug — noted so a future session doesn't "fix" the working FE.)_
- **CC-7 · API omits array fields the TS type marks as required → `.length`/`.map` crashes.**
  Detail endpoints drop empty collections (e.g. `GET /employees/:id` omits `documents` &
  `leaveBalances` for new employees), but types declared them required arrays → runtime
  `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`, caught by the error boundary.
  _Fix pattern: mark the field optional in the type + default `?? []` at every consumer._
  **On every detail/profile screen, create a fresh/empty record and open it** — that's when the
  omitted-array crash surfaces. _(First seen: Employee profile OverviewTab — fixed, commit on `main`.)_
- **CC-9 · Service sends the wrong field name → 400 (required) or silently dropped (optional).**
  The FE sent `{ comment }` to regularization approve/deny, but the backend field is
  **`reviewerComment`** — **deny** (where it's required) 400'd every time = fully broken; **approve**
  (optional) silently dropped the note. _Fix pattern: match the live request body field names exactly._
  **For every write, diff the FE request body keys against a real successful request** — don't trust
  the FE's own naming. _(First seen: attendance regularization approve/deny — fixed, commit on `main`.
  **Seen again: Leave approve/reject** — FE sent `comment`, backend requires **`approverComment`**;
  reject 400'd every time (required field) = fully broken, approve silently dropped the note. Fixed,
  verified live 200 + the reason persists on a follow-up GET.)_ **This is now the #1 recurring bug
  class — the `approverComment` vs `comment` split specifically.** On any approve/reject/deny/review
  write, POST a real request and confirm the field name **and** that the value persists (the
  approve/reject _response_ may omit `approverComment` even when it saved — check via a follow-up GET).
- **CC-10 · Bodyless `apiClient.post(url)` 400s against the LIVE backend.** The axios client
  defaults `Content-Type: application/json` (`api-client.ts`), so a POST with **no body** still
  sends that header with an empty payload — backend routes that JSON-parse a required body then
  choke on `""` → **400 with an empty response body** (the empty body is the tell it's a real-backend
  passthrough, not MSW, which always returns JSON). This was **invisible while the endpoint was
  MSW-backed** (MSW ignores the empty body) and only appeared once the backend went live.
  _Fix pattern: pass an explicit `{}` as the body for action POSTs._ **Audit every bodyless
  `apiClient.post(`…`)`/`.patch(`…`)` for endpoints that are (or are about to go) live.** Known
  remaining candidates to verify when their screens are swept: **`POST /payroll/runs/:id/inputs/from-timesheets`**
  (`payroll-runs.api.ts:208`, bodyless — same risk) and **`PATCH /notifications/:id/read`**
  (`notifications.api.ts`, bodyless — unverified). Auth `logout`/`refresh`/`logout-all` and
  `PATCH /leave/requests/:id/withdraw` are also bodyless but **verified to tolerate** an empty body
  live (200). _(First seen: timesheet **submit-week** — POST `/timesheets/:id/submit` 400'd every
  time; fixed by sending `{}`, verified 200.)_ _(Seen again: payroll **`POST /payroll/runs/:id/inputs/from-timesheets`**
  — bodyless → 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR {field:"unknown","must be object"}`; with `{}` → 200. Fixed. PR-1.)_
  - **Same default-header trap bites FILE UPLOADS.** A `FormData` (multipart) upload posted through the
    shared client carries the default `Content-Type: application/json`, so the browser never sets
    `multipart/form-data; boundary=…` → backend rejects it (**406 `FST_INVALID_MULTIPART_CONTENT_TYPE`**).
    _Fix pattern: pass `headers: { 'Content-Type': undefined }` on the upload request so the browser sets
    the boundaried multipart header._ **Audit every `FormData`/file POST** (`.ics` import, employee
    document upload/presign, avatar, payroll imports). _(Seen: Holidays **.ics import** — fully broken,
    406; fixed + verified end-to-end start 202 → preview 200 → commit 200. HD-1.)_
- **CC-11 · `const { data: x = [] } = useQuery(...)` as a `useEffect` dep → infinite render loop.**
  When a query's `data` is `undefined` (loading/disabled), the `= []` default mints a **new array
  every render**; using it as a `useEffect` dependency makes the effect re-run each render, and if the
  effect calls `setState`/`setValue`/`setDraft` **unconditionally** it re-renders → new `[]` → loops
  until React throws **"Maximum update depth exceeded"** (caught by the error boundary → whole screen
  crashes). _Fix pattern: `const x = useMemo(() => data ?? [], [data])` for a stable ref, **and** guard
  the effect's writes to only fire when the value actually changed (and only act on the array once
  `data` is defined, so a loading `[]` doesn't wipe valid state)._ **Grep every module for
  `data: <name> = []`/`= {}` that feeds a `useEffect`/`useMemo` dep array.** _(First seen: timesheet
  `TimerBar` + `TimeEntryDialog` — `useTasks` tasks array; crashed on project-select / timer-restore. Fixed.)_
- **CC-8 · Write routes gated only by hiding the button, not the route.** `/employees/new` &
  `/employees/[id]/edit` rendered the full form to MANAGER/EMPLOYEE via direct URL (server
  enforces with 403 on submit, so not a security hole — but bad UX). _Fix pattern: wrap the page
  in the new **`RequirePermission`** guard (`src/shared/guards/RequirePermission.tsx`) which shows
  an access-denied state._ **Check every create/edit/delete route** (Departments, Holidays,
  Settings panels, Payroll, Timesheets, Leave-types, etc.) for the same gap and reuse the guard.
- **CC-12 · HR-only data screen with NO role guard → wall of 403s for non-HR roles.** A whole-screen
  dashboard whose every widget hits an HR/SUPER-only endpoint, but the **route/page itself isn't gated**
  and the **nav item isn't role-filtered** (`NAV_ITEMS` in `AppShell.tsx` shows every item to every role).
  A MANAGER/EMPLOYEE clicks it and fires N HR-only endpoints that all **403** — ×3 React Query retries =
  **dozens of failed requests + console errors**, the page a grid of "Failed to load" error states.
  _Fix pattern: wrap the route page in `RoleGate roles={[...]}` with an `ErrorState` fallback (the
  `permissions/page.tsx` pattern) — gated roles then fire **zero** calls and see a clean access-denied._
  **Audit every read-only HR/admin screen** (Analytics done; check Settings sub-panels, any future
  admin-only dashboard). _(First seen: Payroll `/payroll/global` — PR-4, but that one **redirects** rather
  than gates. Seen again: **Analytics `/analytics`** — manager/employee fired 9 endpoints ×3 = 17–27 403s;
  fixed with RoleGate → 0 calls. AN-1.)_ Contrast: **Payroll screens redirect** self-service to
  `/my-payslips`; **Reports/Permissions/Analytics show an access-denied state** — both are acceptable, pick
  per screen (redirect when there's a self-service home; access-denied when there isn't).
- **CC-13 · Decorative filter control that drives no query (silent no-op).** A filter (Select, date range,
  toggle) is rendered and its state updates on change, but that state is **never read by any query** — so
  using the control **fires no network call and changes nothing on screen**. Looks functional, does nothing
  — the silent-failure class this sweep hunts, applied to filters not forms. _Detection: in the browser,
  change the control and assert a refetch actually fires; in code, grep the state var — if it's only in the
  control's own `value`/`onChange` and never in a `queryKey`/`params`, it's dead._ _Fix: either wire it
  through the consuming queries, or remove it so the UI is honest._ _(First seen: **Analytics** top filter
  bar — the **Department Select** and **Custom date range** (`from`/`to`) updated state but no analytics hook
  consumed `departmentId`/`from`/`to`; only the 7d/30d/90d preset worked, and only for the attendance chart.
  **AN-2 — FIXED by wiring** (your call: keep the controls): threaded an optional `AnalyticsFilters`
  `{ departmentId, range, from, to }` through all 9 analytics endpoints; verified the dept-select refetches
  all 9 with `departmentId` (200) and custom range sends `from`/`to` to the short-window widgets (200). The
  **backend currently ignores** these params (returns the unfiltered result) — the filter contract is handed
  off in `docs/BACKEND_API_REQUESTS.md`; data filters with no FE change once the backend honours them. So
  "wire it" is a valid fix even when the backend hasn't implemented filtering yet — the control becomes
  honest immediately (it refetches) and gains data later.)_

### Shared engines/components (note which screens depend on each as we go)

- `DynamicTable` — _used by: **Employees** (list), Departments, Payroll runs, Reports tables, …_
- `DynamicForm` + RHF + Zod — _used by: **Employees edit** (`EmployeeForm`). NOTE: Employee **create**
  uses a separate 4-step wizard `EmployeeFormStepper` (not DynamicForm) — fields share `#df-<name>` ids._
- `RequirePermission` (NEW, `shared/guards`) — route-level permission guard with access-denied state.
  _used by: **Employees** new/edit. Apply to other write routes (CC-8)._
- `FilterEngine`, `ChartEngine` (Recharts: `AreaChart`/`DonutChart`) — _used by: **Dashboard** (HR charts)_
- shadcn `Select` (Base UI — render label not value), `Sheet`/`Dialog`/`Tabs`/`Switch`
- `PageHeader`, `StatsCard`, `SectionCard`, `PermissionWrapper`/`RoleGate`, four-state components
  (`EmptyState`/`ErrorState`/`Skeleton`) — `StatsCard`/`SectionCard`/`PermissionWrapper` used by **Dashboard**
- `NewLeaveRequestDialog` — _used by: **Dashboard** (Employee "Request leave") + Leave screen_ — submit verified 201
- `TodayAttendanceCard` (check-in/out) — _used by: **Dashboard** (Employee) + Attendance screen_ — check-in verified 201
- `PendingApprovalsPanel` / `BulkApproveModal` / `TeamWeeklyAttendanceGrid` — _used by: **Dashboard** (HR/Manager) + Leave/Attendance approvals_ — **regularization approve/deny lives ONLY here** (no approval UI on the Attendance page)
- `RegularizationDialog` / `CheckInOutCard` / `AttendanceCalendar` / `AttendanceTableView` — _used by: **Attendance** page_ (CheckInOutCard also on Dashboard)
- `TimerBar` / `WeeklyGrid` / `TimeEntryDialog` / `TimesheetSubmitBar` / `ApprovalsTab` / `ProjectsPanel`+`ProjectDrawer` — _used by: **Timesheets** page only._ TimerBar timer state is the module's only Zustand slice (`store/timer.slice.ts`, sessionStorage-persisted, survives refresh). `useTasks` (`hooks/useProjects.ts`) feeds both TimerBar & TimeEntryDialog — the CC-11 loop source.
- `LeaveRequestsTable` / `LeaveApprovalsTable` (+ Deny/Bulk dialogs) / `LeaveTeamCalendar` / `NewLeaveRequestDialog` — _used by: **Leave** page._ Approve/reject go through `leave.api.ts` → backend wants **`approverComment`** (LV-1/CC-9). Team views (`useTeamLeaveRequests`/`useTeamLeaveCalendar`) are employee-scoped → 400 for profile-less SUPER_ADMIN (LV-2); the calendar query is `enabled` only for MANAGER/HR/SUPER (employee never fetches it).
- `HolidayScreen` / `HolidayFormDialog` / `IcsImportDialog` / `MonthDetailModal` — _used by: **Holidays** page._ Modal CRUD gated by `canManage` (HR/SUPER) + server 403. `IcsImportDialog` → `holidaysApi.startImport` is a **multipart upload** → must send `Content-Type: undefined` (HD-1/CC-10 upload sub-case), else 406. The MSW `/holidays/import*` handler is **dead** (mocks off).
- `ReportShell` / `ReportsNav` / 15 lazy report panels / `ChartEngine` — _used by: **Reports** page._ All 15 GETs live (200); HR/SUPER only (manager/employee → access-denied + 403). `useExportReport` (`hooks/useWorkforceReports.ts`) drives the **secure async server-export** (RP-1: request job → poll `GET /reports/export/:jobId/download` → download the server file; never client-built CSV). 4 register panels export via the separate `payrollRunsApi.exportRegister` blob path.

_(Fill the "used by" lists during the sweep so a fix in one engine flags every dependent screen.)_

## 6. Already fixed before the sweep (context)

These three were found/fixed leading into this sweep (investigating a stray 400 + the
payroll create-path E2E). All committed to `main`, local:

| Commit    | Fix                                                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `6640cbb` | auth: silent-refresh on `400 INVALID_TENANT`, not just 401                      |
| `f9d42c9` | payroll: drop null component overrides in pay-group writes (was 500)            |
| `cb01083` | employees: salary CTC input rejected round values, blocking save (`step="any"`) |

> **Hand this section to the backend developer.** These are issues whose root cause is in the
> **backend**, not this frontend. Where the frontend has a workaround it is noted, but the proper
> fix is backend-side. Keep appending as the sweep continues. (FE-side bugs are tracked in §8.)

| BE-1 | `GET /auth/me` (and tenant-scoped routes)              | P2  | Returns **`400 INVALID_TENANT`** when the access token is **missing or expired**, instead of `401`. Causes a red console error on **every** page load, and would break silent token-refresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Return **`401 Unauthorized`** for absent/expired/invalid tokens; reserve `400 INVALID_TENANT` for a genuinely bad tenant.                                                                                                     | `GET /auth/me` with no cookie → `400 {code:INVALID_TENANT}`; with a garbage token → same `400`; with valid cookie → `200`.                                        | Yes — axios interceptor treats `400 INVALID_TENANT` like `401` (`6640cbb`). Still noisy; please fix server-side.                                                                                      |
| BE-2 | `POST` / `PATCH /payroll/groups`                       | P1  | **500 `INTERNAL_ERROR`** (`prisma.payGroup.create()` invalid invocation) when a component override is `null` — backend coerces `null → ""`/`0` and feeds it to a Prisma **enum** column **without input validation**.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Validate/normalise the request body; accept omitted/`null` override fields and store `NULL`, don't 500.                                                                                                                       | `POST /payroll/groups` with `components:[{componentId, overrideCalculationType:null,…}]` → 500; with `{componentId}` only → 201.                                  | Yes — FE omits null override fields (`f9d42c9`). Backend still lacks input validation here (likely affects other write endpoints too).                                                                |
| BE-3 | `GET /employees/:id` after Terminate                   | P3  | A **terminated** (soft-deleted) employee returns **`404 NOT_FOUND`**, so their profile is **inaccessible** — HR cannot view or **reverse** a termination from the UI, despite the dialog promising "can be reversed by an administrator".                                                                                                                                                                               | Either keep terminated employees retrievable via `GET /employees/:id`, or expose a documented param (e.g. `?includeTerminated=true`).                                                                                         | Create → `DELETE /employees/:id` (200, status→TERMINATED) → `GET /employees/:id` → **404**.                                                                       | None — needs backend.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| BE-4 | Payroll salary history / effective-dating              | P2  | Salary history rows come back with **`effectiveTo` _before_ `effectiveFrom`** and **duplicate same-day records** after re-assignments. Suggests effective-dating/overlap handling is off — payroll date math can't be trusted until verified.                                                                                                                                                                           | Effective ranges should be ordered (`effectiveFrom ≤ effectiveTo`); superseding an assignment should close the prior range correctly without dupes.                                                                           | Re-assign an employee's pay group on the same day; inspect `GET /payroll/employees/:id/salary` → `history[]`.                                                     | N/A — observation; verify before relying on payroll figures.                                                                                                                                          |
| BE-5 | `GET /leave/team/requests`, `GET /leave/team/calendar` | P2  | Return **`400 NO_EMPLOYEE_ID`** ("User does not have an employee profile") for **SUPER_ADMIN**, because these endpoints are employee-scoped and super_admin has **no** employee profile (`employeeId: null`). So super_admin's Leave **Approvals + Team Calendar** tabs show an error state. **Inconsistent**: `GET /manager/approvals` **does** work for super_admin (200).                                            | Support a profile-less SUPER_ADMIN on the team endpoints (return all/empty like `/manager/approvals`), **or** confirm super_admin isn't meant to use them (then the FE will hide the tabs).                                   | As super_admin: `GET /leave/team/requests` → `400 {code:NO_EMPLOYEE_ID}`; `GET /leave/team/calendar` → same. As HR/MANAGER (have a profile) → 200.                | Partial — error state renders (no crash). FE could hide team tabs for users without an `employeeId`, pending the product call (LV-2).                                                                 |
| BE-6 | `PATCH /leave/requests/:id/{approve,reject}` response  | P3  | The approve/reject **response body omits `approverComment`** even when the value was accepted and **persisted** (a follow-up `GET /leave/requests` shows it). Misleading — looks like the comment was dropped.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Echo the saved `approverComment` in the approve/reject response, matching the `LeaveRequest` shape returned by `GET`.                                                                                                         | Reject with `{approverComment:"X"}` → 200, response `approverComment: undefined`; then `GET /leave/requests` → `approverComment: "X"`.                            | N/A — cosmetic/response-shape; the write itself works (LV-1 fixed).                                                                                                                                   |
| BE-7 | `POST /payroll/runs/:id/cancel`                        | P2  | Requires **SUPER_ADMIN** while the rest of the run lifecycle (initiate/approve/mark-paid/publish) is allowed for **HR_ADMIN**. The FE shows HR a "Cancel Run" button (dialog defaults reason to "Cancelled by HR") → HR gets **403**. FE intent ≠ backend rule.                                                                                                                                                         | Decide the intended role: if HR may cancel before approval, relax to HR_ADMIN; else confirm super_admin-only so the FE gates to match.                                                                                        | As HR: `POST /payroll/runs/:id/cancel {reason}` → `403 {requiredRoles:["SUPER_ADMIN"], userRole:"HR_ADMIN"}`.                                                     | Pending decision (PR-2); FE could gate Cancel to super_admin.                                                                                                                                         |
| BE-8 | `GET /payroll/payslip-templates`                       | P3  | HR-only, but the **self-service my-payslips** page (PayslipDrawer) needs the template to render an employee's own payslip → **403** for MANAGER/EMPLOYEE, fired ×2 per load. Page still renders (handled).                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Expose a read-only payslip template to self-service users (or a dedicated `…/self` endpoint) so payslips render with the configured layout.                                                                                   | As priya/aman on `/payroll/my-payslips`: 2× `GET /payroll/payslip-templates` → 403.                                                                               | Pending decision (PR-3); FE could skip/guard the fetch for self-service.                                                                                                                              |
| BE-9 | `POST /reports/export` async job + download            | P1  | The export endpoint went **async** — returns `202 {jobId, status:"PENDING", message:"Use /export/:job_id/download once ready."}` — but the promised **download/status routes don't exist**: `GET /reports/export/:jobId/download`, `…/:jobId`, `…/:jobId/status`, and top-level `/export/:jobId/*` **all 404**. So an export can be queued but **never retrieved** — the feature is half-built and unusable end-to-end. | Implement the job **status** + **download** endpoints (return the generated CSV as `text/csv` once `status` is ready). The FE already polls `GET /reports/export/:jobId/download` and will work the moment it returns a file. | HR: `POST /reports/export {reportType,format:"CSV"}` → 202 `{jobId}`; then `GET /reports/export/:jobId/download` → **404** (and every status-path variant → 404). | FE made safe (RP-1): no longer downloads the 202 stub / fakes success; shows "being prepared" and downloads only a real server file once available. **Needs the backend download route to function.** |

### Contract / docs to update (not code bugs — backend **docs** are stale)

- **Leave actions are `PATCH`, not `POST`.** `PATCH /leave/requests/:id/{approve,reject,withdraw}` is
  what's live and correct; `CLAUDE.md §3` / `BACKEND_API_REQUESTS.md` list them as `POST`. Update the docs.
- **Timesheets are LIVE on the backend now (CLAUDE.md §27 says "MSW-backed" — stale).** `GET /timesheets`,
  `/timesheets/entries`, `/timesheets/:id/{submit,approve,reject}`, `/timesheets/approvals`,
  `/timesheets/projects(/:id/tasks)`, `/timesheets/settings`, `/timesheets/summary` all answer from the
  real backend (verified 2026-06-10). Move timesheets from "what still needs MSW" to the live list.
- **`POST /timesheets/:id/submit` 400s on an empty body (minor backend inconsistency).** Other action
  routes (`/auth/logout`, `PATCH …/withdraw`) tolerate an empty body and return 200; `submit` requires
  a non-empty JSON body or it 400s. FE now always sends `{}` (TS-2 fix), but consider making action
  endpoints tolerate empty bodies for consistency.
- (Append other `API_MAPPING.md` / `CLAUDE.md §3` drifts here as the sweep finds them.)

## 7. Per-screen findings

> Template per screen — fill during the sweep. Enumerate sub-panels on entry (routes below are
> the starting map; confirm against the live app).

### 1. Dashboard `/dashboard` — ✅ SWEPT, CLEAN (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units / routing:** `DashboardRouter` picks by role → `HRDashboard` (SUPER_ADMIN + HR_ADMIN),
  `ManagerDashboard` (MANAGER), `EmployeeDashboard` (EMPLOYEE).
- **Tested per role (login → load → all widget endpoints → interactions):**
  - **SUPER_ADMIN / HR_ADMIN** → HRDashboard ("Welcome back, …"). Widgets all 200:
    `/analytics/summary`, `/analytics/attendance?range=30d`, `/analytics/headcount-by-department`,
    `/analytics/recent-activity?limit=8`, `/manager/approvals`. Interactions: range toggles
    **7d/90d** fire `/analytics/attendance?range=…` → 200 ✓; PendingApprovalsPanel renders 20
    approve buttons (approve **action deferred to Leave screen**).
  - **MANAGER** → ManagerDashboard ("My Team"). Widgets 200: `/manager/dashboard`,
    `/manager/approvals`, `/attendance/team/weekly?weekStart=…`. **Bulk-approve modal** opens &
    loads (9 pending pre-selected) ✓ (approve action deferred to Leave screen).
  - **EMPLOYEE** → EmployeeDashboard ("Hi, Priya"). Widgets 200: `/employee/dashboard`,
    `/attendance/today`, `/leave/types`, `/holidays?year=2026`, `/employee/documents`,
    `/employee/team`, `/timesheets?week=…`. Interactions: **Request-leave dialog** submit →
    `POST /leave/requests` **201** ✓; **check-in** → `POST /attendance/check-in` **201** ✓.
- **Findings:** **none — 0 issues.** Loads clean for all 4 roles (no console errors beyond the
  known CC-3 auth-boot 400/401 noise; no API 4xx/5xx). Every interactive control fires its
  network call (no silent failures).
- **Carry-forward notes:**
  - Leave withdraw is **PATCH** not POST (see CC-6) — confirmed live 200 while cleaning up.
  - HR/SUPER_ADMIN PendingApprovalsPanel reads `/manager/approvals` (shared with Manager).
  - **Deferred to later screens:** approve/deny (Leave), bulk-approve (Leave), team weekly grid
    (Attendance) — exercised "open + loaded" here, destructive approve tested on home screens.
  - **Test residue (harmless, test DB):** priya now has a check-in record for today; the test
    leave request was withdrawn (cleaned).

### 2. Employees `/employees` — ✅ SWEPT, 2 issues fixed (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units:** list (search / dept / status filters, pagination, row actions), `/employees/new`
  (4-step wizard `EmployeeFormStepper`: Personal→Job→Documents→Access), `/employees/[id]` profile
  tabs (Overview, Job, **Compensation** [HR only], Documents, Attendance, Leave, Activity),
  `/employees/[id]/edit` (`EmployeeForm`/DynamicForm), Terminate (type-to-confirm).
- **Per role:**
  - **SUPER_ADMIN / HR_ADMIN:** list 20 rows + "Add Employee" ✓. Full write flow exercised:
    create via stepper → **POST /employees 201** ✓; all 7 profile tabs visited; edit →
    **PATCH 200** ✓; terminate → **DELETE 200** ✓.
  - **MANAGER:** sees list, **no "Add" button** (correct). After fix, `/new` + `/[id]/edit` → access-denied ✓.
  - **EMPLOYEE:** sees only own 1 row, no "Add" (correct). After fix, `/new` + `/[id]/edit` → access-denied ✓.
- **Findings (both FIXED):**
  - **EMP-1 (P1):** OverviewTab crashed (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`)
    on a freshly-created employee — `GET /employees/:id` omits `documents`/`leaveBalances`. → CC-7. Fixed.
  - **EMP-2 (P2):** `/employees/new` + `/[id]/edit` not permission-guarded — MANAGER/EMPLOYEE could
    open the form by URL (server enforces 403 on submit). → CC-8. Fixed with `RequirePermission`.
- **Observations (not bugs):**
  - Server **enforces** employee writes: POST/PATCH/DELETE → **403** for MANAGER & EMPLOYEE (verified live).
  - Compensation tab `GET /payroll/employees/:id/salary` → **404** for unassigned employee = expected empty state (handled).
  - **Backend quirk (P3, backend-side):** after Terminate (soft-delete), `GET /employees/:id` → **404**,
    so a terminated employee's profile is **inaccessible** (can't review/reverse from the UI). Worth raising with backend.
- **Carry-forward:** create wizard ≠ edit form (separate components); `RequirePermission` guard now
  exists — apply to other write routes. Terminate-then-404 quirk may affect any "view terminated employee" flow.

### 3. Departments `/departments` — ✅ SWEPT, CLEAN (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units:** org tree (nested `children[]`, 8 roots), detail panel (sub-teams grid + Members table
  `DepartmentEmployeesTable`), create/edit/add-sub/delete — **all modal-based** (`DepartmentForm` dialog,
  `ConfirmDialog`, reassign-and-delete dialog). **No `/new` or `/edit` routes → CC-8 N/A here.**
- **Per role:**
  - **SUPER_ADMIN / HR_ADMIN:** tree + "Add department" + 8 row action menus. Write flow all fire:
    create root **POST 201**, edit **PATCH 200**, add sub-dept **POST 201**, delete (root, via UI) **DELETE 200** ✓.
  - **MANAGER / EMPLOYEE:** can **view** the tree (8 items) but **"Add" hidden + 0 row menus** (correct
    `PermissionWrapper departments:write` gating). Server also **enforces**: POST/PATCH/DELETE → **403**.
- **Findings:** **none — 0 issues.** No console errors, no API 4xx/5xx for any role.
- **Not exercised:** reassign-and-delete (delete a dept that has employees → move-then-delete dialog) —
  skipped to avoid reassigning real employees; wiring mirrors the verified empty-delete path.
- **Carry-forward:** modal-based CRUD pattern (no routes) — gating via PermissionWrapper + server 403
  is the correct combo; contrast with Employees' route-based forms (which needed CC-8 RequirePermission).

### 4. Attendance `/attendance` — ✅ SWEPT, 1 issue fixed (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units:** summary cards (`/attendance/summary`), dept/employee filters (HR/Manager), month nav,
  calendar ↔ table view toggle (`nuqs` URL state), `CheckInOutCard`, `RegularizationDialog` (request),
  `DayDetailDrawer`. **Regularization approve/deny is NOT on this page** — it lives in the dashboard
  `PendingApprovalsPanel` (tested there as part of this sweep).
- **Per role:**
  - **SUPER_ADMIN / HR_ADMIN / MANAGER:** summary + check-in card + **dept/employee filters** + reg
    button; table view fires `/attendance/records|team`. Clean.
  - **EMPLOYEE:** summary + check-in card + reg button, **no filters** (correct). Clean.
  - **Regularization request** (employee, via UI) → `POST /attendance/regularization` **201** ✓.
  - **Approve** (HR, dashboard panel) → `PATCH …/approve` **200** ✓.
- **Findings (FIXED):**
  - **ATT-1 (P1):** **Deny regularization was fully broken** — service sent `{ comment }` but the
    backend requires **`reviewerComment`** → `PATCH …/deny` **400** every time. Approve had the same
    wrong key (silently dropped the note). → CC-9. Fixed (both now send `reviewerComment`); deny
    verified **200** end-to-end via the dashboard.
- **Observations:** no console errors / no other 4xx-5xx for any role; check-in/out already verified
  (Dashboard). `nuqs` view/month/filter state all drive the right record fetches.
- **Carry-forward:** the `comment` vs `reviewerComment` mismatch (CC-9) — audit other approve/deny/review
  payloads (Leave reject uses `comment` too — **verify it's the right key when sweeping Leave**).

### 5. Timesheets `/timesheets` — ✅ SWEPT, 2 issues fixed (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units / tabs (role-gated in `TimesheetScreen`):** **My Timesheet** (`canWrite` = all roles)
  — `TimerBar` (Zustand timer) + `WeeklyGrid` (`TimeEntryDialog`, submit bar); **Approvals**
  (`canApprove` = MANAGER + elevated) — `ApprovalsTab` approve/return; **Projects** (`canAdmin` =
  HR/SUPER only) — `ProjectsPanel` + `ProjectDrawer` CRUD. _(Utilization report lives in **Reports**;
  the timesheet **settings** panel lives in **Settings** — both swept with those screens, not here.)_
- **⚠️ Live/mock reality:** timesheets is **now LIVE on the backend** (not MSW as CLAUDE.md §27 says).
  Verified via direct BFF probe as priya: `GET /timesheets?week` returns real **cuid** ids + real
  entries; `POST /entries`, `/:id/submit`, `/approvals`, `/projects` all hit the backend. (`prj-seed-N`
  project ids are **backend** seed data, not MSW.) **CLAUDE.md §27 "MSW-backed" is stale — flag for docs.**
  _(Correction: `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS` is **OFF** for the whole sweep — MSW is **not running at all**.
  Holidays confirmed this: `POST /holidays/import` returns a Fastify **406**, not the MSW mock — if MSW
  were on it would have intercepted. So "the backend answers first" really means "MSW is off, everything
  is live." Any endpoint still only in MSW will **fail** in this config — see HD-1.)_
- **Per role:**
  - **SUPER_ADMIN / HR_ADMIN:** 3 tabs (My Timesheet, Approvals, Projects). Grid + projects load 200.
  - **MANAGER:** 2 tabs (My Timesheet, Approvals) — Projects correctly hidden. **Approve → POST
    `/:id/approve` 200 ✓; Return(reject) → POST `/:id/reject` 200 ✓** (both send `{ comment }`; reject
    requires it — no CC-9 mismatch). Seeded SUBMITTED week present in the approvals queue.
  - **EMPLOYEE (priya):** 1 tab (My Timesheet only) — Approvals/Projects correctly hidden, **and server
    enforces**: `GET /timesheets/approvals|settings|summary` → **403** for employee. Entry create →
    **POST /entries 201 ✓**; submit week → **POST /:id/submit 200 ✓** (after TS-2 fix); timer
    start/restore no longer crashes (after TS-1 fix).
- **Findings (both FIXED):**
  - **TS-1 (P1):** **`TimerBar` (and `TimeEntryDialog`) crashed with "Maximum update depth exceeded"**
    → error boundary takes down the whole timesheet view. Triggered by **selecting a project in the
    TimerBar** (or **restoring a running timer on refresh** — a documented feature of the timer slice).
    Root cause: `const { data: tasks = [] } = useTasks(...)` mints a new `[]` each render while the
    tasks query is loading, and that array is a `useEffect` dep whose body calls `setDraft`/`setValue`
    unconditionally → infinite loop. → **CC-11.** Fixed: memoize the array (`useMemo(() => data ?? [])`)
    - guard the writes + only clear a stale task once tasks are loaded. Verified no-crash on both paths.
  - **TS-2 (P1):** **Submit-week 400'd every time** — `timesheetsApi.submit` did
    `apiClient.post(`/timesheets/:id/submit`)` with **no body**; axios's default
    `Content-Type: application/json` + empty body → backend JSON-parse fails → **400 (empty body)**. The
    employee's core "submit my week" action was fully broken against the live backend (showed a "Failed
    to submit" toast). → **CC-10.** Fixed: send `{}`. Verified **200** end-to-end via the browser (was
    invisible while MSW-backed; only surfaced once timesheets went live).
- **Observations (not bugs):** no other console errors / 4xx-5xx for any role beyond the known
  CC-3 auth-boot 400/401 noise; role gating is correct in UI **and** enforced server-side (403s).
  `nuqs` `?tab=` state drives the right tab. Reject requires a comment (zod + backend 422) — correct.
- **Carry-forward:** CC-10 (bodyless POST) + CC-11 (loading-`[]` effect-dep loop) are now general
  patterns — apply on every remaining screen. **Verify the live/mock state of each remaining screen**
  (timesheets being live was a surprise). Next bodyless-POST to verify when swept: payroll
  `POST /runs/:id/inputs/from-timesheets`, `PATCH /notifications/:id/read`.
- **Test residue (harmless, test DB):** priya's current week + a future week were submitted; the
  seeded approvals week was approved + another returned. Seed accounts remain usable.

### 6. Leave `/leave` — ✅ SWEPT, 1 FE fix + 1 backend issue logged (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units / tabs (`LeaveScreen`):** **My Requests** (all roles) — `LeaveRequestsTable` +
  `NewLeaveRequestDialog` (create) + inline **Withdraw** (confirm dialog); **Team Calendar** (all
  roles, but query `enabled` only for MANAGER/HR/SUPER); **Approvals** (`canApprove` = MANAGER/HR/SUPER)
  — `LeaveApprovalsTable` inline Approve / Deny-dialog / bulk approve+reject + coverage chip.
  **Live, not MSW** (no `mocks/handlers/leave.ts`; real cuid ids + real validation).
- **Per role:**
  - **HR_ADMIN:** 3 tabs, all load clean (approval queue happened to be empty at sweep time; the
    MANAGER run exercised the same shared approve/deny path → 200).
  - **MANAGER (aman):** 3 tabs. **Approve → PATCH `/approve` 200 ✓; Deny → dialog → PATCH `/reject`
    200 ✓** (after LV-1 fix). Team Calendar loads.
  - **EMPLOYEE (priya):** **2 tabs (no Approvals)** ✓. **Create → POST `/leave/requests` 201 ✓;
    Withdraw → PATCH `/withdraw` 200 ✓** (bodyless PATCH — CC-10 tolerated, re-confirms CC-6).
    Team Calendar tab fires **no** `/team/calendar` call (query disabled for employee → gated
    empty state, no 403 spam). Server also enforces: priya hitting `/leave/team/{requests,calendar}`
    directly → **403**.
  - **SUPER_ADMIN:** 3 tabs, but **Approvals + Team Calendar 400** — see LV-2.
- **Findings:**
  - **LV-1 (P1, FIXED):** **Leave reject was fully broken** — `leave.api.ts` sent `{ comment }` but
    the live backend requires **`approverComment`** → `PATCH /reject` **400 (VALIDATION_ERROR:
    approverComment required)** every time. **Approve** had the same wrong key → 200 but the note was
    **silently dropped**. → **CC-9** (same class as attendance ATT-1). Fixed both to send
    `approverComment`; verified live **200** + the reason **persists** on a follow-up GET, and via the
    UI (MANAGER approve+deny 200). _(Bulk approve/reject were fine — backend accepts any/no comment, 200.)_
  - **LV-2 (P2, backend — logged in §6B):** **SUPER_ADMIN's Approvals + Team Calendar tabs 400 with
    `NO_EMPLOYEE_ID` "User does not have an employee profile."** The `/leave/team/*` endpoints are
    employee-scoped and SUPER_ADMIN has **no employee profile** (employeeId null), so the tabs render an
    **error state** for super_admin only. Inconsistent with `/manager/approvals`, which **does** work
    for super_admin (200). FE shows the tabs to super_admin (`canApprove`/`canViewTeam` include
    SUPER_ADMIN). **Not FE-fixed** — it's a product/backend call (should super_admin approve leave? then
    backend must support profile-less super_admin on team endpoints; if not, FE should hide those tabs
    for users without an employeeId). Flagged for the user + backend.
- **Observations (not bugs):** withdraw/approve/reject are **PATCH** (CC-6, FE correct, docs stale);
  no console errors / no other 4xx-5xx for HR/MANAGER/EMPLOYEE; create maps date fields via
  `formatDateForApi` (YYYY-MM-DD) correctly.
- **Carry-forward:** the `approverComment` field is now the **#1 recurring bug** (attendance + leave) —
  audit every remaining approve/reject/deny/review write (Payroll run approve, Timesheets already
  checked — uses `comment` and that's what its backend wants). Verify field name **and** value
  persistence each time.
- **Test residue (harmless, test DB):** several `ZZZ E2E` leave requests for priya (far-future 2027
  dates) in various states (rejected/approved/withdrawn) from the API + UI probes. Seed accounts intact.

### 7. Holidays `/holidays` — ✅ SWEPT, 1 issue fixed (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units (`HolidayScreen`, modal-based — no routes → CC-8 N/A):** year grid (`?year=` via local
  state) + month-detail modal; All-holidays list + selected detail card; **Add Holiday** / **Edit** /
  **Delete** (`HolidayFormDialog` + `ConfirmDialog`); **Import .ics** (`IcsImportDialog`: pick → preview
  → commit). All **live** (CRUD + import); MSW handler for `/holidays/import*` exists but is **dead code
  now** (mocks off — see below). Form fields: name, date (`type=date`), location, optional checkbox —
  **no numeric inputs (CC-1 N/A)**.
- **Per role:**
  - **HR_ADMIN / SUPER_ADMIN** (`canManage`): Add + Import .ics buttons + per-row action menus. Full
    CRUD verified — **create 201, edit 200, delete 200** (HR via UI; super_admin via API). `isOptional`
    - `location` persist correctly (**no CC-9**). **SUPER_ADMIN works fine** here (holidays are
      tenant-level, not employee-scoped — contrast Leave LV-2).
  - **MANAGER / EMPLOYEE:** year grid renders (read), but **no Add / no Import / no row menus** (correct
    `canManage` gating). Server also **enforces**: `POST /holidays` → **403**.
- **Findings (FIXED):**
  - **HD-1 (P1):** **`.ics` import was fully broken — `POST /holidays/import` 406
    `FST_INVALID_MULTIPART_CONTENT_TYPE` "the request is not multipart".** The multipart `FormData`
    upload was sent through the shared axios client, which carries the default
    `Content-Type: application/json`, so the browser never set `multipart/form-data; boundary=…`. The
    backend **does** implement import (proper multipart → 202 + jobId; preview 200; commit 200 — all
    verified live), so this was purely the FE content-type. → **CC-10 (file-upload sub-case).** Fixed by
    passing `headers: { 'Content-Type': undefined }` on `startImport`. Verified end-to-end in the
    browser: **start 202 → preview 200 → commit 200**, preview table renders, no console errors.
- **Observations (not bugs):** **this screen proved mocks are OFF** — the 406 is a Fastify error, not the
  MSW mock (MSW would have intercepted `/holidays/import`). So MSW isn't running; **any endpoint still
  only in MSW will fail** in this env. Create/update send `holidayDate` via `formatDateForApi`
  (YYYY-MM-DD) — correct.
- **Carry-forward:** **audit every other `FormData`/file upload** for the same content-type bug —
  employee **document upload/presign** (`employees` module, multipart per CLAUDE.md §3), avatar, any
  payroll import. The MSW `/holidays/import*` handler is now dead (mocks off) — could be deleted, or
  kept for a mocks-on demo; left as-is.
- **Test residue:** all `ZZZ E2E` holidays (created + imported, 2027) deleted at end of the run. Clean.

### 8. Payroll `/payroll` — 🐞 CORE SWEPT, 1 fix + 2 gating issues (2026-06-10) · panels partial

- **Live state (mocks OFF):** **every top-level payroll GET now returns 200** — `runs, roster, components,
groups, schedules, countries, legal-entities, statutory-packs, pay-calendars, payslip-templates,
event-catalogue, events, cost-summary, workers, contractor-invoices, opening-balances,
reimbursement-categories/-claims, migration, reports, settings, employees, payment-batches`. The §26
  "404s" (migration/reports/settings/employees/payment-batches) **have since shipped.** Runs page shape is
  **`{ items[], pagination }`** (FE type matches — `items`, not `runs`).
- **Gating:** HR_ADMIN / SUPER_ADMIN → runs screen ("Run Payroll" button). **MANAGER / EMPLOYEE →
  redirected to `/payroll/my-payslips`** (self-service). Server enforces: employee `GET /payroll/roster|runs`
  → **403**.
- **Run lifecycle (verified live, throwaway 2025 runs):** initiate `POST /runs` **201** → calculate
  `POST /runs/:id/calculate {}` **202 → REVIEW** → approve `POST /runs/:id/approve {notes}` **200 (APPROVED)**
  → mark-paid `PATCH /runs/:id/mark-paid {paidAt,paymentReference}` **200 (PAID)** → publish `POST .../publish {}`
  **200 (published)**. All these send a body and work.
- **Findings:**
  - **PR-1 (P1, FIXED):** **"Import from timesheets" was fully broken** —
    `POST /payroll/runs/:id/inputs/from-timesheets` was a **bodyless** POST → **400
    `VALIDATION_ERROR {field:"unknown","must be object"}`**; with `{}` → **200**. → **CC-10.** Fixed
    (`payroll-runs.api.ts` `importInputsFromTimesheets` now sends `{}`); API-verified 200 (one-line body
    add, same pattern as TS-2/HD-1).
  - **PR-2 (P2, gating — logged §6B BE-7):** the run-detail **"Cancel Run" button is shown to HR_ADMIN**
    (gated on `perms.canInitiate`), but the backend **requires SUPER_ADMIN** to cancel → HR clicking Cancel
    gets **403 FORBIDDEN** (`requiredRoles:["SUPER_ADMIN"]`). The cancel dialog even defaults the reason to
    "Cancelled by HR", so FE intent ≠ backend rule. **Not fixed pending your call** (gate FE to super_admin,
    or backend should allow HR) — like LV-2.
  - **PR-3 (P2/P3, gating — logged §6B BE-8):** the **self-service my-payslips page** (PayslipDrawer →
    `usePayslipTemplate`) fires **`GET /payroll/payslip-templates` → 403** for MANAGER/EMPLOYEE (the
    template endpoint is HR-only). Fires **2× on every load**; the page still renders (handled, no console
    error) but it's noisy and the self-service payslip can't use the configured template. **Not fixed
    pending your call** (FE skip/guard the template fetch for self-service, or backend allow read).
- **Observations:** `approve` sends `{notes}` — accepted (200), though the run's `approvals[]` came back
  empty (note may persist elsewhere; not blocking). No other bodyless payroll writes (the rest send `{}`/a
  body). FnF number inputs have no `step` (CC-1 N/A).
- **PR-2/PR-3 — FIXED (your call: gate FE).** PR-2: added a SUPER_ADMIN-only `canCancel` to
  `usePayrollPermissions`; the run-detail Cancel button now uses it (verified: HR no longer sees Cancel,
  super_admin does). PR-3: gated `usePayslipTemplate` to elevated roles so self-service doesn't fetch the
  HR-only template (verified: 0 template calls for an employee). BE-7/BE-8 stay flagged for the backend.
- **Panel follow-up pass (done):** `/payroll/global` (GlobalWorkforceScreen — cost summary, workers,
  contractor invoices) and `/payroll/migration` (all **5** panels: Pay Calendar / Opening Balances /
  Historical Payslips / Parallel Run / Go-Live) and a run-detail (all panels) **load clean for HR** — no
  4xx/5xx, no console errors. The editor panels (Salary Components / Pay Groups / Statutory Packs / Legal
  Entities / Payslip Template / Data Policy) live under **Settings → Pay & Compliance** and are swept with
  **screen 12 (Settings)**, not here. Migration/run-detail writes all send a body (no CC-10).
  - **PR-4 (P2, FIXED):** **`/payroll/global` had no role guard** — unlike `/payroll` (PayrollScreen) and
    `/payroll/migration` (MigrationScreen), which redirect self-service roles. An employee/manager opening
    `/payroll/global` by URL got a page whose every data endpoint (`workers`, `cost-summary`,
    `contractor-invoices`, `countries`) **403s** → all error states. Fixed: mirror the sibling guard
    (redirect non-HR/admin → `/payroll/my-payslips`). Verified: employee → my-payslips, HR still loads.
  - **Still not driven (lower priority):** individual run-detail **write actions** (create payment batch,
    adjust payslip, hold/release/reprocess payslip, journal/statutory/register exports) and the migration
    **write forms** (create pay calendar, save opening balance, import historical payslips, go-live toggle)
    — all load clean and their service calls send proper bodies; exercising each write E2E is a deeper pass.
- **Test residue (test DB, harmless):** throwaway 2025 runs left — `2025-01` PAID+published, `2025-02`
  DRAFT (cancel 403'd), `2025-03` REVIEW. All 2025 periods, won't affect seed accounts.

### 9. Reports `/reports` — ✅ SWEPT, 1 FE fix (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units:** single route `/reports`; a sticky `ReportsNav` switches among **15 lazy panels** via
  `?report=`. Each panel = summary + chart (`ChartEngine`) and/or table + an **Export** button
  (`ReportShell`). Report GET endpoints (`/reports/workforce|attendance|leave|payroll/*`) all **live, 200**.
- **Per role:**
  - **HR_ADMIN / SUPER_ADMIN:** all **15 panels render clean** — chart and/or table per type, **no console
    errors, no 4xx/5xx** (headcount, turnover, demographics, attendance summary, absenteeism, leave
    utilization, leave pending, payroll summary, ctc-analysis, salary/statutory/bank-advice/variance
    registers, pay-equity, timesheets utilization).
  - **MANAGER / EMPLOYEE:** reach `/reports` but see an **access-denied UI**; server also enforces
    (`GET /reports/*` → **403**). Correct gating.
- **Findings (FIXED):**
  - **RP-1 (P1):** **Every report's CSV export was broken.** `POST /reports/export` is now an **async
    job** → `202 { jobId, status:"PENDING", message:"Use /export/:job_id/download once ready." }` (JSON),
    but the FE used `responseType:'blob'` and **downloaded that 202 JSON stub as `<report>-report.csv`**
    with a false **"Report exported"** toast — users got a ~158-byte JSON file, not the report. → contract
    drift (backend went async). **Per your call (security):** download must come **from the server**
    (a server-generated file can't be tampered with via devtools, unlike a client-built CSV). Fixed:
    `requestExport()` queues the job, `downloadExport()` polls `GET /reports/export/:jobId/download` and
    returns the **server** file; we download **only a real server file**, and show an honest "being
    prepared" message until it's ready (no fake download/success). Verified: POST 202 → polls /download →
    **no garbage file**, honest toast. **Backend-blocked to complete (BE-9):** the download route 404s
    today; when it ships, this works end-to-end with no FE change.
- **Observations (not bugs):** 4 panels show no Export button (demographics, leave/pending, ctc-analysis,
  pay-equity) — by design (no server export wired for those). The **4 payroll register** reports
  (Salary/Statutory/BankAdvice/Variance) export via a **separate** path —
  `payrollRunsApi.exportRegister` → `GET /payroll/runs/:id/register/export` (direct blob, needs a selected
  run) — **not** the `/reports/export` async flow; that path was **not** driven E2E (verify when convenient).
- **Carry-forward:** the `/reports/export` async pattern (202 job → poll server download) is the secure
  export model — reuse it if other screens add server exports. Don't build CSVs from client-loaded data.

### 10. Analytics `/analytics` — ✅ SWEPT, 2 FE fixes (AN-1 role gate + AN-2 filter wiring) (2026-06-10)

- **Sub-units (single page `AnalyticsPage`, no sub-routes):** top filter bar (`RangeSelector` 7d/30d/90d +
  custom range; Department `Select`); 7 rows — KPI cards (`/analytics/summary`), Attendance Trend
  (`/analytics/attendance?range=`), Headcount donut (`/headcount-by-department`) + Leave Summary bar
  (`/leave-summary`), Recent Activity (`/recent-activity?limit=` + Load-more), Workforce Trend
  (`/workforce-trend?range=6m|12m|2y`, own toggle), Attrition (`/attrition`, own toggle) + Payroll Cost
  (`/payroll-cost?range=6m|12m`, own toggle), Department Performance table (`/department-performance?range=30d|90d`,
  own toggle). Reuses dashboard analytics hooks + 4 analytics-module hooks (`useWorkforceTrend`/`useAttritionTrend`/
  `usePayrollCostTrend`/`useDepartmentPerformance`).
- **⚠️ Live reality (mocks OFF):** **all 11 analytics endpoints are LIVE + 200 for HR/SUPER** — including the
  4 the §4 pointer feared were "MSW-only → 404" (`workforce-trend`, `attrition`, `payroll-cost`,
  `department-performance`). **They've shipped** — no 404s. (Probe: `scripts/probe-analytics.mjs`.)
- **Per role:**
  - **SUPER_ADMIN / HR_ADMIN:** page renders **clean** — 9 analytics GETs on load all **200**, all 7 rows
    render (KPI cards, area/line/composed/donut/bar charts, activity table, dept table). **No console errors
    / no 4xx-5xx** beyond the known CC-3 auth-boot 400/401 noise. Interactions fire: per-chart **6m→12m
    toggle → `workforce-trend?range=12m` 200 ✓**; attendance 7d/30d/90d preset → `attendance?range=` refetch.
  - **MANAGER / EMPLOYEE (before fix):** **no role guard** → opened the page and fired **9 HR-only endpoints
    → all 403**, ×3 React Query retries = **17 (manager) / 27 (employee) failed requests** + console errors;
    the page a grid of "Failed to load" error states. (Manager incidentally got **200** on
    `department-performance` only; everything else 403; employee 403 on all 11. Server enforces — these are
    HR/SUPER-only endpoints.) → **CC-12.**
  - **MANAGER / EMPLOYEE (after fix):** clean **access-denied** state, **0 analytics calls fired**.
- **Findings:**
  - **AN-1 (P2, FIXED):** **`/analytics` route had no role guard** while every widget hits an HR/SUPER-only
    endpoint → manager/employee got a wall of 403s + console errors (CC-12). The nav item is also unfiltered
    (`NAV_ITEMS` shows Analytics to every role). Fixed: wrapped the route page in
    `RoleGate roles={['SUPER_ADMIN','HR_ADMIN']}` with an `ErrorState` fallback (the `permissions/page.tsx`
    pattern). Verified in-browser: employee/manager → 0 analytics calls + access-denied; HR/SUPER unchanged
    (9 calls, all 200). Commit `853c465`.
  - **AN-2 (P3, FIXED — your call: keep + wire):** **the top filter bar's Department `Select` and Custom date
    range were dead controls** — selecting a department or applying a custom range **fired no network call and
    changed nothing** (no analytics hook read `departmentId`/`from`/`to`; `range='custom'` even made the
    attendance chart fall back to 30d). → **CC-13.** Fixed by **wiring**, not removing: threaded an optional
    `AnalyticsFilters { departmentId, range, from, to }` (in `dashboard.types`) through the shared dashboard
    analytics service/hooks (summary, attendance, headcount, leave-summary, recent-activity) and the
    analytics-module trend hooks (workforce-trend, attrition, payroll-cost, department-performance). All params
    **optional** → the **Dashboard** screen (which passes none) is unaffected. `departmentId` scopes all 9;
    a custom `from`+`to` window drives the short-window widgets (summary/attendance/leave-summary, overriding
    the preset) while the 4 long-trend charts keep their own range + get `departmentId`. **Live endpoints
    accept+ignore these params today (probed — all still 200)**, so it shipped with no regression; the backend
    filter contract is handed off in `docs/BACKEND_API_REQUESTS.md` ("Analytics filter parameters") — data
    filters with zero FE change once the backend honours them. Verified in-browser: **dept-select → all 9
    refetch with `departmentId` (200); custom range → `from`/`to` on the short-window widgets (200); HR load
    unchanged; no non-auth 4xx/5xx.** Commit `04770b2`.
- **Observations (not bugs):** the per-chart range toggles (6m/12m/2y on workforce/attrition, 6m/12m on
  payroll-cost, 30d/90d on dept-perf) are **independent local state** and each **does** refetch correctly —
  these are fine; only the **top-bar** Department/Custom controls are dead. No bodyless writes (all-GET
  screen — CC-10 N/A); no `useEffect`-dep array loops observed (CC-11 N/A).
- **Carry-forward:** **CC-12** (unguarded HR-only screen → 403 wall) and **CC-13** (decorative no-op filter)
  are now general patterns — apply on Settings + any remaining admin dashboard. The nav (`NAV_ITEMS`) is
  **unfiltered by role** — every screen owes its own route-level gate (guard or redirect).

## 9. Resume prompt (paste into a new session)

```
Resume the EMS frontend screen-by-screen QA sweep. FIRST read
docs/testing/SCREEN_SWEEP.md end to end — it is the source of truth for scope,
rules of engagement, progress, cross-cutting memory, and the issue tracker.
Then continue from the "Next action" pointer in §4.

Cadence: sweep the next screen for ALL roles (superadmin@acme.test,
hr@acme.test, aman@acme.test=MANAGER, priya@acme.test=EMPLOYEE; password
Password123!; no AUDITOR). Drive it with Playwright (resolution path in §3),
capturing console errors, network 4xx/5xx, the four states, and — critically —
assert every form/drawer actually fires a network call on submit (silent-failure
catch). Log every finding into the per-screen section (§7) and the issue tracker
(§8); add any backend-root-cause issue to the **For-the-backend-team** list (§6B);
update the cross-cutting memory (§5) and progress table (§4). Then FIX that
screen's issues (pnpm typecheck + pnpm lint clean, commit each with a
conventional message), tick them off, and PAUSE for my review before the next
screen.

It's a TEST database: full writes incl. irreversible (approve/mark-paid/
terminate/delete) are allowed, but use throwaway "ZZZ E2E" records for
destructive tests so the seed role accounts stay usable. Verify against the LIVE
API, not docs. Throwaway probe scripts go in scripts/ (untracked, delete after).
```
