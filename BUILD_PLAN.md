# BUILD_PLAN.md — Execute one step at a time

> **For Claude Code.** This is an ordered build runbook. Execute it ONE STEP AT A TIME, top to bottom.
>
> **The rules of this file (do not violate):**
>
> 1. Read `CLAUDE.md` fully before starting any step. Re-read the referenced sections at each step.
> 2. Do exactly ONE step per turn. Never jump ahead. Never batch steps.
> 3. After building a step, run its **Test Gate**. Show me the command output.
> 4. If the Test Gate fails, FIX IT before moving on. Do not proceed with a failing gate.
> 5. If the Test Gate passes, commit with the given message, then STOP and tell me the step is done. Wait for me to say "next" before starting the following step.
> 6. If a step is ambiguous or you must make an assumption, state the assumption and ask before building. Do not invent backend endpoints — only auth is real (CLAUDE.md §3).
> 7. Keep each step's work scoped to that step. Do not refactor unrelated code.
>
> **How I (the user) drive this:** I will say "start step N" or "next". You execute that one step, test it, commit it, and stop. We repeat until the plan is done.

## Standard Test Gate (applies to every step unless overridden)

```bash
pnpm typecheck      # must be clean — zero errors
pnpm lint           # must be clean — zero errors
```

For any step that adds a screen or visible UI, ALSO:

```bash
pnpm dev            # boots without errors; the new route renders
```

(Manually confirm the route loads at http://localhost:3000, then stop the server.)

A step is DONE only when its Test Gate passes AND the step-specific "Definition of done" checklist is satisfied.

---

## STEP 1 — Foundations

**Goal:** Design tokens, providers, the API client with auth interceptor, and token storage. No screens yet.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §2, §4, §9, §10, §12.

**Build:**

1. `src/styles/tokens.css` — full token set from `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §2 (colors light+dark, typography, spacing, radius, shadows, motion). Wire into Tailwind.
2. `src/lib/env.ts` — already created by bootstrap; verify it parses correctly.
3. `src/lib/query-client.ts` — TanStack Query client with sensible defaults: `retry: 2`, `staleTime: 30_000`, and a global error behavior so failed queries don't crash the UI.
4. `src/lib/api-client.ts` — Axios instance. Request interceptor attaches `x-tenant-key` (from env) and `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Response interceptor: on 401, attempt one refresh via `/auth/refresh`, retry once, else clear auth and redirect to `/login`.
5. `src/lib/auth.ts` — in-memory access token storage (NOT localStorage), helpers to set/get/clear.
6. `src/providers/` — `QueryProvider`, `ThemeProvider` (data-theme attribute for dark mode), `AuthProvider` (calls `/auth/me` on mount). Compose them in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

**Definition of done:**

- Tokens render (a test element using `bg-surface text-primary` shows correct colors).
- `pnpm dev` boots with providers mounted, no console errors.
- No screen built yet — this is plumbing.

**Test Gate:** Standard (typecheck + lint + dev boots).

**Commit:** `feat: foundations — tokens, providers, api client, auth plumbing`

---

## STEP 2 — Layout shell

**Goal:** The visual frame every authenticated screen sits in, plus the auth frame.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §5; `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` (screens 1 and 4 show the shells).

**Build:**

1. `src/shared/layouts/AppShell.tsx` — sidebar (nav: Dashboard, Employees, Departments, Attendance, Leave, Holidays, Permissions, Settings) + topbar (search, notifications, user menu). Sidebar collapse state in Zustand, persisted.
2. `src/shared/layouts/AuthShell.tsx` — centered card layout for auth screens.
3. `src/shared/layouts/PageHeader.tsx` — breadcrumb + title + actions slot.
4. `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — uses AppShell.
5. `src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx` — uses AuthShell.

**Definition of done:**

- Both layouts render with placeholder content inside.
- Sidebar nav items present (links can be dead for now).
- Responsive: sidebar collapses on narrow widths.
- Dark mode toggle works (even if just in user menu).

**Test Gate:** Standard. Manually confirm both `(dashboard)` and `(auth)` route groups render their shells.

**Commit:** `feat: AppShell, AuthShell, PageHeader layouts`

---

## STEP 3 — Login screen (real backend)

**Goal:** Working login against the REAL backend. This is the one screen that is not mocked.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §4, §10, §11; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 01.

**Build:**

1. `src/modules/auth/` module skeleton.
2. `src/modules/auth/validations/login.schema.ts` — Zod: email + password.
3. `src/modules/auth/services/auth.api.ts` — `login`, `refresh`, `logout`, `me`.
4. `src/modules/auth/hooks/useLogin.ts` — React Query mutation.
5. `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` + `src/modules/auth/components/LoginForm.tsx` — RHF + Zod form, all four states (idle, submitting, error, success).

**Definition of done:**

- Submitting valid seed credentials (CLAUDE.md §4) logs in and redirects to `/dashboard`.
- Invalid credentials show an inline error, no crash.
- Network failure (e.g. backend cold-starting) shows a friendly error with retry, no crash.
- Loading state on the button while submitting.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual login test with a real seed user. If the backend is asleep (Render cold start), the first attempt may be slow — confirm the loading state holds and it eventually succeeds or shows a clean error.

**Commit:** `feat: login screen with real backend auth`

---

## STEP 4 — Auth guard + route protection

**Goal:** Unauthenticated users can't reach dashboard routes.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §10.

**Build:**

1. Guard logic in `(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — if no valid session (via AuthProvider / `/auth/me`), redirect to `/login?next=<path>`.
2. `src/shared/guards/PermissionWrapper.tsx` — gates UI by permission; pulls abilities from `useAuth()`.
3. `src/shared/guards/RoleGate.tsx` — optional, gates by role.
4. After login, honor the `?next=` param.

**Definition of done:**

- Visiting `/employees` while logged out redirects to `/login`.
- After login, redirects back to the originally requested route.
- `<PermissionWrapper permission="x:write">` correctly hides/shows children.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: log out, try a deep link, confirm redirect; log in, confirm return.

**Commit:** `feat: auth guard and permission wrapper`

---

## STEP 5 — MSW infrastructure + first mock

**Goal:** Mock Service Worker wired up so all non-auth data is mocked realistically.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §3; `docs/PROJECT_SETUP_FRONTEND.md` §8.

**Build:**

1. `src/mocks/browser.ts`, `src/mocks/server.ts`, `src/mocks/handlers/index.ts`.
2. Conditional start: MSW runs only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCKS=true`.
3. One proof-of-life handler (e.g. `GET /health-mock`) returning the standard envelope.
4. Confirm auth requests PASS THROUGH to the real backend (not intercepted).

**Definition of done:**

- With mocks on, the proof-of-life endpoint resolves through React Query.
- Auth still hits the real backend.
- Envelope shape matches CLAUDE.md §4 exactly.

**Test Gate:** Standard. Confirm in browser network tab that the mock intercepts and auth passes through.

**Commit:** `feat: MSW infrastructure with passthrough auth`

---

## STEP 6 — Feedback components

**Goal:** The reusable state components every screen depends on.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §13; `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §4.8.

**Build:**

1. `src/components/feedback/Skeleton.tsx` (or compose shadcn's).
2. `src/components/feedback/EmptyState.tsx` — title, description, optional action.
3. `src/components/feedback/ErrorState.tsx` — message, retry button, optional request id.
4. `src/components/data-display/StatsCard.tsx` — label, value, delta, loading state.
5. `src/components/feedback/ConfirmDialog.tsx`.

**Definition of done:**

- Each renders in isolation with sample props.
- All support dark mode via tokens.

**Test Gate:** Standard.

**Commit:** `feat: feedback and data-display primitives`

---

## STEP 7 — Employees module skeleton

**Goal:** Module scaffold + MSW handler + fixtures. No screen yet.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §6; the `/new-module` command.

**Build:** Run the equivalent of `/new-module employees`:

1. Module folders + `index.ts`.
2. `validations/employee.schema.ts` (Zod).
3. `types/employee.types.ts`.
4. `services/employees.api.ts` (list/get/create/update/delete).
5. `hooks/useEmployees.ts`, `useEmployee.ts`, mutations.
6. `src/mocks/handlers/employees.ts` matching the API contract.
7. `src/mocks/data/employees.ts` — 30 realistic fixtures.

**Definition of done:**

- `useEmployees()` returns mocked data through React Query.
- Mock returns the standard envelope with pagination.

**Test Gate:** Standard.

**Commit:** `feat: employees module skeleton with mocks`

---

## STEP 8 — Employees list screen

**Goal:** The directory screen. The most-used screen in the app.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §7, §8, §13; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 07.

**Build:**

1. `src/app/(dashboard)/employees/page.tsx`.
2. `src/modules/employees/components/EmployeeTable.tsx` — build DIRECTLY with TanStack Table (do not extract an engine yet — that's step 12).
3. Filter bar (search, department, status), pagination, status chips, row actions.
4. All four states.

**Definition of done:** CLAUDE.md §15 checklist. Loading skeleton, empty state, error state, success all work. Permission gate on "Add Employee".

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: list renders, search filters, pagination works, simulate an error (toggle a mock to 500) and confirm the UI shows ErrorState, not a crash.

**Commit:** `feat: employees list screen`

---

## STEP 9 — Employee profile screen

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §8; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 08.

**Build:** `employees/[id]/page.tsx` + profile header card + tabs (Overview, Job, Documents, Attendance, Leave, Activity). Overview tab fully built; others can be placeholder panels.

**Definition of done:** §15 checklist. Self/manager/HR permission differences respected per CLAUDE.md §10.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: click a row in the list → profile loads.

**Commit:** `feat: employee profile screen`

---

## STEP 10 — Employee create/edit form

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §11; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 09.

**Build:** `employees/new/page.tsx` + `employees/[id]/edit/page.tsx` sharing an `EmployeeForm`. RHF + Zod. Map 422 errors to fields. Build directly (no DynamicForm engine yet).

**Definition of done:** §15. Validation works; server error mapping works; success redirects to the profile.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: create flow adds a row (in mock); validation errors display inline.

**Commit:** `feat: employee create and edit forms`

---

## STEP 11 — Departments module + screen

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §6; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 10.

**Build:** `/new-module departments`, then the tree + detail screen.

**Definition of done:** §15. Tree renders nested; selecting a node loads detail.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual.

**Commit:** `feat: departments module and screen`

---

## STEP 12 — Extract engines (DynamicTable + DynamicForm)

**Goal:** You now have 2+ tables and 2+ forms. Extract the shared engines. THIS is the right time (CLAUDE.md §7) — not earlier.

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §7; `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §4.1, §4.2; the `/refactor-to-engine` command.

**Build:**

1. `src/shared/engines/DynamicTable/` — generic, column-config driven.
2. `src/shared/engines/DynamicForm/` — generic, schema + field-config driven.
3. Refactor EmployeeTable and DepartmentTable to use DynamicTable.
4. Refactor EmployeeForm to use DynamicForm.

**Definition of done:** §15. Both screens still work identically after refactor. Engines are generic (no domain knowledge).

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: employees list and departments still behave exactly as before.

**Commit:** `refactor: extract DynamicTable and DynamicForm engines`

---

## STEP 13 — Attendance module + screen

**Read first:** `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 11.

**Build:** `/new-module attendance`, then the calendar grid + month summary screen. Use FilterEngine if you build one here.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual.

**Commit:** `feat: attendance module and screen`

---

## STEP 14 — Leave module + screen

**Read first:** `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 12.

**Build:** `/new-module leave`, then the approvals table (tabs: My Requests, Approvals, Team Calendar, Balances). Use DynamicTable.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: approve/deny updates the row optimistically; failure rolls back with a toast.

**Commit:** `feat: leave module and screen`

---

## STEP 15 — Holidays module + screen

**Read first:** `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 13.

**Build:** `/new-module holidays`, then the 12-month year grid.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual.

**Commit:** `feat: holidays module and screen`

---

## STEP 16 — Permissions matrix screen

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §10; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 14.

**Build:** `permissions/page.tsx` — role × permission checkbox matrix. Custom component (not a generic engine). Super Admin only.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: toggling marks dirty; Save enabled only when dirty.

**Commit:** `feat: permissions matrix screen`

---

## STEP 17 — Settings screen

**Read first:** `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screen 15.

**Build:** `settings/page.tsx` — left nav + Company Profile form panel.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual.

**Commit:** `feat: settings screen`

---

## STEP 18 — Dashboards (HR, Manager, Employee)

**Read first:** CLAUDE.md §8; `docs/WIREFRAMES.pdf` screens 04, 05, 06.

**Build:** `/new-module dashboard`. Role-aware `dashboard/page.tsx` rendering the correct dashboard per role. Reuse StatsCard; build ChartEngine wrapping Recharts. Use Suspense boundaries with skeletons per CLAUDE.md §8.

**Test Gate:** Standard + manual: log in as each seed role, confirm the right dashboard renders.

**Commit:** `feat: role-aware dashboards`

---

## STEP 19 — Global polish

**Goal:** Make failures graceful and the app cohesive.

**Build:**

1. `src/app/error.tsx` and per-route `error.tsx` boundaries — friendly fallback, never a white screen.
2. Global query error handling: ensure every failed fetch shows ErrorState or a toast, never an unhandled throw.
3. Full dark mode pass on every screen.
4. a11y pass: keyboard nav, focus rings, aria labels, `prefers-reduced-motion`.
5. Loading skeletons audited on every data screen.

**Definition of done:** Kill the backend (or set an invalid API URL) and click through the app — nothing crashes; every screen shows a clean error or empty state.

**Test Gate:** Standard + the "kill the backend" manual test above.

**Commit:** `feat: error boundaries, dark mode, and a11y polish`

---

## STEP 20 — Final verification + demo readiness

**Build:**

1. Run the full `/verify` checklist.
2. `pnpm build` — production build must succeed.
3. Click through the 5 demo-critical screens end to end: Login → HR Dashboard → Employees list → Profile → Leave approval.
4. Deploy to Vercel; set env vars there; confirm the deployed URL works.
5. Confirm CORS: the deployed frontend can reach the backend (backend dev must whitelist the Vercel URL).

**Definition of done:**

- `pnpm build` succeeds.
- All 5 demo screens work on the deployed URL.
- No console errors in production build.

**Test Gate:**

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
```

Plus manual click-through on the deployed URL.

**Commit:** `chore: demo-ready build`

---

## If you (Claude Code) are unsure at any point

- Re-read the relevant CLAUDE.md section. The answer is usually there.
- If genuinely ambiguous, ask me. Do not guess at backend behavior.
- Never mark a step done with a failing Test Gate.
- Never proceed to the next step without me saying "next".
